- 👋 Hi, I’m Joshua van Staden
- 👀 I’m interested in Machine Learning. Specifically, my research is centered on gait recognition; however, I enjoy exploring a diverse set of machine learning algorithms and use cases.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning CNNs and LSTMs mainly. But, overall, I am learning a lot about Machine Learning.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on pretty much anything interesting. More than anything, I am hoping to build up some experience with this stuff.
- 📫 How to reach me: g14v2805@campus.ru.ac.za. Alternatively, joshvstaden14@gmail.com.
